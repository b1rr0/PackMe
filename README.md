## Overview

PacMe was developed as a demonstration of custom file compression techniques. It combines well-known algorithms to create an efficient and compact archiving tool.

This project was also used to illustrate the concept of **trees**, specifically **Huffman trees**, in the context of data compression.

## Features

- Compresses files into a custom `.PackMe` format  
- Uses **Huffman coding** for entropy-based compression  
- Applies the **Z-function** for pattern detection and optimization  
- Supports both compression and decompression  

## Technologies

- Programming Language: **Go**  
- Framework: [Wails](https://wails.io)  
- Algorithms: Huffman coding (binary trees), Z-function  

## Usage

PacMe is intended for:

- Educational purposes  
- Demonstrating compression algorithm concepts  
- Studying **Huffman trees** and other data structures  
- Experimenting with file archiving and format creation  

## Development

To run the project in development mode:

```bash
wails dev
